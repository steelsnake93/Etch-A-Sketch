 Project: Etch-A-Sketch from The Odin Project

In this project I will go to create sketchpad.

Assignments:

- create a web page with 16x16 grid of square div's using Javascript.
- set up "hover" effect so the grid div's change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixilated) trail through your grid like a pen would.
- Add a button to the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid.
